DevSecOps approach in Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines

Description


In recent years, with the adoption of cloud computing and containerized
microservices, software systems have started to be more and more advanced and complex. This evolution brings many benefits but also comes with disadvantages such as high operational costs and greater exposure to cyber vulnerabilities.

In order to reduce these disadvantages as much as possible and to increase collaboration between development teams and operations teams, the concept of DevOps appeared, which introduces automated testing and deploying applications from an early stage and then DevSecOps, which adds automated security testing to classic DevOps.

This project proposes the implementation of a Kubernetes-native pipeline respecting the DevSecOps principles that aims to accelerate the software development process without neglecting critical aspects, thus ensuring the delivery of secure systems.
